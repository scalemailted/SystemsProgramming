# Team Project: Convert Java Code to C Code

## Introduction

In this team project, you will work together to convert a Java application into a C application. This project is designed to enhance your coding skills, collaboration abilities, and understanding of programming languages. The original code is a simple To-Do List application written in Java, and your task is to rewrite it in C.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure that you and your team members have a good understanding of the following:

- Basic knowledge of programming concepts in both Java and C.
- Familiarity with the C syntax and standard libraries.
- An integrated development environment (IDE) or code editor for C (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code with C/C++ extensions, or any C-compatible IDE).
- A compiler for C (e.g., GCC for Linux or MinGW for Windows).

## Project Objectives

Your team's goal is to convert the provided Java code into equivalent C code, replicating the functionality of the original To-Do List application. The converted C code should maintain the same features and behavior as the original Java application.

## Steps to Complete the Project

Follow these steps to successfully complete the project as a team:

1. **Team Formation**: Divide your team into roles and responsibilities. Assign tasks such as coding, testing, and documentation to team members based on their strengths and expertise. Make sure everyone is clear about their responsibilities.

2. **Code Conversion**: Start by translating the Java code into C. Pay attention to syntax differences between the two languages, such as variable declarations, input/output, and memory management.

3. **Testing**: Test the C code thoroughly to ensure it functions correctly. Debug any issues that arise during testing. Verify that the converted application produces the same results as the original Java version.

4. **Code Review**: Conduct code reviews within your team to identify potential improvements or optimizations. Ensure that the code is well-documented and follows coding standards.

5. **Documentation**: Create documentation that explains how the C code works, any modifications or challenges encountered during the conversion process, and any decisions made during development.



## Tips and Best Practices

- Collaborate and communicate effectively within your team. Share updates, progress, and challenges regularly.

- Use version control systems like Git to manage your project and track changes.

- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code. Good documentation is crucial for understanding and maintaining the codebase.

- Make use of the source code examples from class.

- Test your C code thoroughly to catch any errors or issues early in the development process.
